            <article>
                <p>
                    JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies
                    of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2023, 98.7% of websites use JavaScript on the
                    client side for webpage behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web
                    browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.
                </p>
                <p>
                    JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript
                    standard. It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.
                    It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has
                    application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions,
                    standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or
                    graphics facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs
                    for I/O.
                </p>
                <p>
                    JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but are now core components of some
                    servers and a variety of applications. The most popular runtime system for this usage is Node.js.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two
                    languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.

            <article>
                <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The
                    JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking.
                    JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs
                    which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.</p>
                <p>
                    In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a
                    runtime system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string
                    values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based object
                    model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary
                    for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative
                    requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.
                </p>
                <p>
                    JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables,
                    classes, and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or
                    protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function return
                    types are not explicitly typed.

                    A "Hello world!" Example

            <article>
                <p>JavaScript is one of the most popular modern web technologies! As your JavaScript skills grow, your
                    websites will enter a new dimension of power and creativity.</p>
                <p>However, getting comfortable with JavaScript is more challenging than getting comfortable with HTML
                    and CSS. You may have to start small, and progress gradually. To begin, let's examine how to add
                    JavaScript to your page for creating a Hello world! example.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Go to your test site and create a new folder named <code>scripts</code>. Within the scripts
                        folder, create a new text document called <code>main.js</code>, and save it.
                    </li>
                    <li>In your <code>index.html</code> file, enter this code on a new line, just before the closing
                        <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tag: <code>&lt;script&gt; src="scripts/main.js">&lt;/script&gt;</code>
                    </li>
                    <li>This is doing the same job as the <code>&lt;link&gt;</code>
                        element for CSS. It applies the JavaScript to the page, so it can have an effect on
                        the
                        HTML (along with the CSS, and anything else on the page).
                    </li>
                    <li>Add this code to the <code>main.js</code> file: <code>const myHeading = document.querySelector("h1");
                        myHeading.textContent = "Hello world!";</code></li>
                </ol>
            </article>
        </section>

        <section id="Variables" class="main-section">
            <header>
                <h2>Variables</h2>
            </header>
            <article>
                <p>Variables are containers that store values. You start by declaring a variable with the let keyword,
                    followed by the name you give to the variable: <br>
                    <code>let myVariable;</code>
                </p>

                <p>
                    A semicolon at the end of a line indicates where a statement ends. It is only required when you need
                    to separate statements on a single line. However, some people believe it's good practice to have
                    semicolons at the end of each statement. There are other rules for when you should and shouldn't use
                    semicolons.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can name a variable nearly anything, but there are some restrictions. (See this section about
                    naming rules.) If you are unsure, you can check your variable name to see if it's valid.
                </p>
                <p>JavaScript is case sensitive. This means myVariable is not the same as myvariable. If you have
                    problems in your code, check the case! </p>
                <p> After declaring a variable, you can give it a value: <br>
                    <code>myVariable = "Bob";</code> <br>
                    Also, you can do both these operations on the same line: <br>
                    <code>let myVariable = "Bob";</code> <br>
                    You retrieve the value by calling the variable name: <br>
                    <code>myVariable;</code> <br>
                    After assigning a value to a variable, you can change it later in the code: <br>
                    <code>
                        let myVariable = "Bob"; <br>
                        myVariable = "Steve";
                    </code>
                </p>
            </article>

        <section id="Comments" class="main-section">
            <header>
                <h2>Comments</h2>
            </header>
            <article>
                <p>Comments are snippets of text that can be added along with code. The browser ignores text marked as
                    comments. You can write comments in JavaScript just as you can in CSS: <br>
                    <code>/* <br>
                        Everything in between is a comment. <br>
                        */</code>

                </p>
                <p>
                    If your comment contains no line breaks, it's an option to put it behind two slashes like this: <br>
                    <code>// This is a comment</code>
                </p>
            </article>

            </header>
            <article>
                <p>An operator is a mathematical symbol that produces a result based on two values (or variables). In
                    the following table, you can see some of the simplest operators, along with some examples to try in

            </header>
            <article>
                <p>Functions are a way of packaging functionality that you wish to reuse. It's possible to define a body
                    of code as a function that executes when you call the function name in your code. This is a good
                    alternative to repeatedly writing the same code. You have already seen some uses of functions. For
                    example: <br>
                    <code>let myVariable = document.querySelector("h1");</code> <br>
                    <code>alert("hello!");</code>
                </p>
                <p>
                    These functions, <code>document.querySelector</code> and <code>alert</code>, are built into the
                    browser.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can also define your own functions. In the next example, we create a simple function which takes
                    two numbers as arguments and multiplies them: <br> <code>
                        function multiply(num1, num2) { <br>
                            let result = num1 * num2; <br>
                            return result; <br>
                          }
                    </code>
                </p>
            </article>
        </section>

        <section id="Events" class="main-section">
            <header>

            <article>
                <p>
                    Real interactivity on a website requires event handlers. These are code structures that listen for
                    activity in the browser, and run code in response. The most obvious example is handling the click
                    event, which is fired by the browser when you click on something with your mouse. To demonstrate
                    this, enter the following into your console, then click on the current webpage: <br>
                    <code>
                        document.querySelector("html").addEventListener("click", function () { <br>
                            alert("Ouch! Stop poking me!"); <br>
                          });
                    </code>
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are a number of ways to attach an event handler to an element. Here we select the
                    <code>&lt;html&gt;</code>
                    element. We then call its <code>addEventListener()</code> function, passing in the name of the event
                    to listen to
                    (<code>'click'</code>) and a function to run when the event happens.

                <p>Programming languages all have built-in data structures, but these often differ from one language to
                    another. JavaScript has 8 Datatypes:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>String</li>
                    <li>Number</li>
                    <li>Bigint</li>
                    <li>Boolean</li>
                    <li>Undefined</li>
                    <li>Null</li>
                    <li>Symbol</li>
                    <li>Object</li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>The Object data type</strong> can contain:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>An object</li>
                    <li>An array</li>
                    <li>A date</li>
                </ol>
