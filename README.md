## Project Overview

This project is a simple documentation page that provides an introduction to JavaScript, including important concepts such as variables, operators, functions, and events. The page includes a fixed navigation bar that links to various sections of the documentation, making it easy for users to navigate.

The primary goal of this project was to implement the layout and design for a technical documentation page that is both responsive and accessible. The project meets the FreeCodeCamp curriculum's requirements for the **Responsive Web Design** course.
